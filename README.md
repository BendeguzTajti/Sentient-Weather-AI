# Sentient-Weather-AI

This is a weather app with a slight twist: the app can recognize any city or location based on the user's speech input.
It can also find the latest weater data based on the user's current location.

The app has a day and night theme that changes based on the location's current time.

The user can also toggle between temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and the selected unit will be saved and remambered next time the app is opened.
